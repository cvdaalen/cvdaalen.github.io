### Research Interests
My research interests include several aspects of autonomous navigation of robotic vehicles, namely computer vision, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), dense mapping, conflict (collision) detection and avoidance, and motion planning.  The application field of my research include various types of autonomous vehicles (aerial, terrestrial, underwater) that operate in environments that are uncertain, dynamic and cluttered.
